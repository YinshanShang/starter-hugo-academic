title: Income and Geographic Segregation across Colleges in China
summary: _With [Mingyu Chen](https://www.mingyu-chen.com/) and [Ernest Liu](https://scholar.princeton.edu/ernestliu/home)_  <br /> We analyze the segregation in college admission system of China by linking data of all college admitted students between 2006 and 2011 to county level income and population data. We exploit geographic variation of income and test performance to estimate within-county inequality. We found college admission rate is very equal across all income groups. Students from low income regions are disadvantaged in going to the several top colleges, but the disadvantage nearly disappears if we extend coverage to all elite colleges (around top 100). For the several top colleges, the income segregation is largely driven by preference towards local students. The updated estimates of inequality is very close to that using county level data directly, implying that most inequality arises from differences across geographic regions.
