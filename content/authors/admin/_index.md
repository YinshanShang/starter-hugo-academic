<span style="font-size:larger;">Welcome! I am a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy \& Finance at Princeton University. Before that, I completed my undergrad at the University of Hong Kong with majors in Economics and Mathematics. I am broadly interested in microeconomic theory and development. Specifically, I want to study the interaction between social structure, individual behavior, and economic inequality.</span>
